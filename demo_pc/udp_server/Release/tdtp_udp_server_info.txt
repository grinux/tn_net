
     This application is used together with TN NET "UDP_Test_2" example.

     When a "Receive to file" radio button is selected in the "UDP_server" dialog
  window, the device sends a on-the-fly generated file (~4Mbytes) to the application,
     When "Send file" radio button is selected in the "UDP_server" dialog window,
  a file from the PC (an user should choose the file name) is transferred to the device.
     Both transfers are performed with TDTP protocol.

     A "Data acquisition" section in the "UDP_server" dialog window performs a data
  acquisition process by the application request. After pressing the "Start" button,
  the application (in the infinite loop) sends a request to the device and
  the device sends a data to the "UDP_server".
     The transfer is performed with TDTP protocol.

     Both "Receive to file"/"Send file" and "Data acquisition" tasks can work
  simultaneously.



   For the Windows(c) Vista(c) users:
  ------------------------------------

    If you got some unstable data exchange and/or a PING utility with -t option
  sometimes reports "General failure":

     - update a network card driver (especially a Realtek RTL8168/8111 PCI-E)
       to the latest version

     - check a Windows Firewall settings

     - check an additional network security software (antiviruses etc.) settings
