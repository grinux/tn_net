  ------------------------------------

    If you got some unstable data exchange and/or a PING utility with -t option
  sometimes reports "General failure":

     - update a network card driver (especially a Realtek RTL8168/8111 PCI-E)
       to the latest version

     - check a Windows Firewall settings

     - check an additional network security software (antiviruses etc.) settings
